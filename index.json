Chem. 1969, 41, 37; Rusch \u0026amp; Lelieur, Anal. Chem. 1973, 45, 1541) is sometimes used to describe the shapes of optical spectra, or chromatographic line shapes. It can be written in the following form.\nfFS(x)={Aexp⁡[−ln⁡2b2{ln⁡(1+2b(x−x0)w)}2]b≠0,2b(x−x0)w\u0026gt;−10b≠0,2b(x−x0)w≤−1Aexp⁡[−4ln⁡2(x−x0)2w2]b=0f_{\\rm FS}(x) = \\begin{cases} {A \\exp \\left [ \\frac{-\\ln 2}{b^2} \\left \\lbrace \\ln \\left ( 1 + \\frac{2b(x-x_0)}{w} \\right ) \\right \\rbrace ^2 \\right ] } \u0026amp; b \\neq 0, {\\frac{2b(x-x_0)}{w} \u0026gt; -1} \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; b \\neq 0, {\\frac{2b(x-x_0)}{w} \\leq -1} \\\\ {A \\exp \\left [ -4 \\ln 2 \\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{w^2} \\right ]} \u0026amp;b = 0 \\end{cases} Here, the function is defined piecewice, since the analytical function in the first line of the definition does not exist for all xx , nor for b=0b = 0 . Unfortunately, this cannot be fixed. (BTW, it appears, from limited numerical tests, that our piece-wisely defined skewed Gaussian (cases b≠0b \\neq 0 ) is continuous and differentiable in xx everywhere.)\nBelow, I give a Python/numpy implementation of this function. It is \u0026lsquo;vectorised\u0026rsquo;, i.e. it handles numpy vectors for high-speed computation, but can also handle individual floats as an argument. The skewed Gaussian is parametrised by AA (the height of the peak), x0x_0 (the position of the peak), ww (proportional to the width of the peak) and bb (the \u0026lsquo;skewness\u0026rsquo;, or asymmetry). It handles the case where the analytical function vanishes (where the argument of the logarithm ceases to be positive). It also handles the case b=0b =0 , by switching to the symmetric Gaussian below a certain threshold value of bb (where bb will considered to be \u0026lsquo;close\u0026rsquo; to zero).\nThis implementation seems to be robust and works for our practical applications, but it may certainly be improved upon.

The samples may indeed be expensive, but that is not because of the gold. Our measurement techniques are very sensitive, and thanks to the very strong optical response of colloidal gold particles, only very small amounts of gold are needed to \u0026ldquo;see something\u0026rdquo;.\nTo illustrate this, \u0026ldquo;industry standard\u0026rdquo; colloidal gold has a concentration of gold particles such that its optical density is 1 (\u0026ldquo;OD 1\u0026rdquo;, meaning that a 1 cm thick sample absorbs 90% of the light at a particular wavelength). If we take 20 nm particles, this gives a concentration of 1.1 nM (650 billion particles in a ml). The amount of gold in a typical 1 ml sample is 54 µg.\nA typical commercially available 25 ml quantity of colloidal gold suspension contains the equivalent of 1.3 mg of gold. The value of the gold is then about 5 eurocents (2015 prices)!\nColloidal solutions of gold nanoparticles by Julien Navarro.There\u0026rsquo;s less than 1 eurocent of gold in each cell. Interestingly, gold becomes red when in the form of very small particles, a fascinating phenomenon.\nWhen we do resonant light scattering spectroscopy (see for example this paper), we may work with concentrations on the order of 0.1 pM (about 60 million particles in a ml) for 80 nm gold particles. The active detection volume of our spectrometer can be estimated to be about 1 µl (therefore containing 60000 particles), which means that we are routinely measuring 0.3 nanograms of gold (less than a billionth of a gram!).\nIn our microfluidic work (such as the electrokinetics stuff and this work), the observed volume is typically 1000 times smaller still (1 picoliter), and when we look carefully through the microscope we can indeed see the particles individually. We may try counting them, even though their incessant Brownian motion complicates this task. A single 100 nm gold nanosphere has a mass of 10 femtogrammes.\n","permalink":"https://mhvwerts.github.io/posts/typical-amount-of-gold/","summary":"We are actually working with only very small quantities of gold.","title":"The amount of gold that we typically work with"}]
